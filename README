Dependencies
------------
You need the following development headers and libraries for building:

qtbase(5 or 6)-dev     (qt(5 or 6)-devel)
qt(5 or 6)-tools-dev                     for language translations
qttools(5 or 6)-dev                      for language translations
libasound2-dev         (libalsa-devel)
libjack-dev            (jackit-devel)
liblo-dev              (liblo-devel)     for nsm support
lv2-dev                (lv2-devel)       for building the LV2 modules
libpango1.0-dev                          for building robtk LV2 UIs 
libcairo2-dev                            for building robtk LV2 UIs 
libpugl-dev                              for building robtk LV2 UIs


Installation with cmake (qmidiarp >= 0.6.7, defaults to Qt6)
-------------------------------------------
After unpacking:
cd qmidiarp-<version>
mkdir build
cd build
(for configuration: ccmake ..)
cmake ..
make
sudo make install


Installation with auto* tools (defaults to Qt6)
---------------------------
For building with autoconf/automake as build system. For short

  ./configure [--enable-qt5]
  make
  make install

does the trick. Please refer to the INSTALL file for more information.


Git check-out
-------------
If you start with a fresh Git checkout, please first make sure you have
the following packages installed: 

autoconf
automake
libtool

If this is the case, run

  autoreconf -i

in the top of the source tree to get a proper configure script. For more 
instructions about compiling and installing this application please 
refer to the INSTALL file.


Doxygen documentation
---------------------
If you have doxygen installed, you can use

make doxygen-doc

to produce functional html documentation of all classes. The html files
are written to the doxygen-doc directory.
