/*! @brief Drawing widget for visualization of arp patterns using QPainter
 *
 * ArpScreen is created and embedded by ArpWidget. The painter callback
 * analyses the pattern string and produces a streak map of its content
 * similar to a piano roll display. The display is updated
 * by calling ArpScreen::updateData() with the pattern text string as
 * and argument. A cursor is placed at the corresponding pattern index
 * by calling ArpScreen::updateCursor() with the integer current pattern
 * index as an overloaded member.
