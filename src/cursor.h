/*! @brief Drawing widget for visualization the cursor using QPainter

 * Cursor is created and embedded by SeqWidget. The painter
 * produces a streak whose location is a function of module resolution,
 * size transferred through the Cursor::updateNumbers()
 * and and frame position transferred by Cursor::updatePosition(). The
 * drawing update is done by Cursor::updateDraw().
