/*! @brief ALSA sequencer backend QThread class.
 *
 * SeqDriver is created by Engine at the moment of program start. Its
 * constructor registers ALSA seq input port and the requested number of
 * output ports. It is called with a portless JackDriver instance for
 * connection to JACK Transport.
 * The SeqDriver::run() thread is the ALSA sequencer "callback" process
 * handling all incoming and outgoing sequencer events.
 * When the SeqDriver::setTransportStatus() function is called with True
 * argument, a so called "echo event" is scheduled to ALSA with zero time.
 * ALSA will send the echo events back
 * to the process and call Engine::echoCallback() regularly to query for
 * events to be scheduled. Incoming MIDI events from ALSA are transferred
 * to the Engine::eventCallback(). Engine will use the sendMidiEvent()
 * function to schedule events. After the event output, a new echo
 * event is requested for the next MIDI event to be output, which will
 * again call the SeqDriver::run() thread, and so on.
 * In order to provide accurate synchronization with external sources
 * such as Jack Transport or an incoming ALSA MIDI clock,
 * SeqDriver works with snd_seq_real_time timing information when it
 * communicates with the ALSA queue. Internally, the real time information
 * is rescaled to a simpler tick-based timing, which is currently 192 tpqn
 * using the deltaToTick() and tickToDelta() functions.
