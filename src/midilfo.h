/*! @brief MIDI worker class for the LFO Module. Implements a sequencer
 * for controller data as a QObject.
 *
 * The parameters of MidiLfo are controlled by the LfoWidget class.
 * The backend driver thread calls the Engine::echoCallback(), which will
 * query each module, in this case via
 * the MidiLfo::getNextFrame() method. MidiLfo will fill a frame from
 * its internal MidiLfo::data buffer as a function of the position of
 * the driver's transport. MidiLfo::frame is then accessed by Engine. It
 * has size 1 except for resolution higher than 16th notes.
 * The MidiLfo::data buffer is populated by the getData() function
 * at each modification done via the LfoWidget. It can consist of
 * a classic waveform calculation or a hand-drawn waveform. In all cases
 * the waveform has resolution, offset and size attributes and single
 * points can be tagged as muted, which will avoid data output at the
 * corresponding position.
