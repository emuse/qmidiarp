/*! @brief MIDI worker class for the Seq Module. Implements a monophonic
 * step sequencer.
 *
 * The parameters of MidiSeq are controlled by the SeqWidget class.
 * The backend driver thread calls the Engine::echoCallback(), which will
 * query each module, in this case via
 * the MidiSeq::getNextFrame() method. MidiSeq will return a note from
 * its internal MidiSeq::data buffer as a function of the position of
 * the driver's transport. The MidiSeq::data buffer is populated by the
 * MidiSeq::getData() function at each modification done via
 * the SeqWidget. It is modified by drawing a sequence of notes on the
 * SeqWidget display or by recording incoming notes step by step. In all
 * cases the sequence has resolution, velocity, note length and
 * size attributes and single points can be tagged as muted, which will
 * avoid data output at the corresponding position.
