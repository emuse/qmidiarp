 /*!
 * @brief MIDI worker class for the Arpeggiator Module. Implements the
 * functions providing note arpeggiation.
 *
 * The parameters of MidiArp are controlled by the ArpWidget class.
 * The backend driver thread calls the Engine::echoCallback(), which will
 * query each module, in this case via
 * the MidiArp::getNextFrame() method. MidiArp will then call its
 * internal MidiArp::getNote() function which produces an array of notes
 * stored in its internal output buffer. The notes in the array depend
 * on the active MidiArp::pattern, envelope, random and groove settings.
 * The note events consist of timing information
 * (tick and length), note values and velocity values. MidiArp::getNote()
 * also advances the pattern index. Engine::tickCallback() then
 * accesses this output buffer and sends it to the backend driver. Engine
 * also calls MidiArp::handleEvent() in particular to store incoming notes
 * in its note buffer.
