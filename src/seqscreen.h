/*! @brief Drawing widget for visualization of sequences using QPainter
 *
 * SeqScreen is created and embedded by SeqWidget. The painter callback
 * produces a streak map of a waveform as a piano roll display. The
 * display is updated by calling SeqScreen::updateData() with the
 * Sample vector as argument followed by updateDraw().
 * SeqScreen emits mouse events combining the Qt mousePressed()
 * and mouseMoved() events. The mouse position is transferred as a
 * double from 0 ... 1.0 representing the relative mouse position on the
 * entire SeqScreen display area.
